# Phalanx Antivirus - Development Roadmap

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic database structure for storing file entries
- ✅ Memory management functions (create, destroy, add entries)
- ✅ Entry structure with directory and file name storage

## Phase 1: Core Scanning Engine

### 1.1 File System Traversal
- [ ] Implement recursive directory scanning
- [ ] Filter for executable files (.exe, .elf, .bin, etc.)
- [ ] Handle symbolic links and special files
- [ ] Add file permission checking
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for large scans

### 1.2 Signature Database
- [ ] Expand Entry structure to include:
  - File hash (MD5/SHA256)
  - File size and modification time
  - Virus signature patterns
  - File type classification
- [ ] Implement signature loading from external files
- [ ] Add support for multiple signature formats (ClamAV, YARA rules)
- [ ] Create signature update mechanism

### 1.3 File Analysis
- [ ] Implement file hashing (MD5, SHA256)
- [ ] Add pattern matching for known virus signatures
- [ ] Implement heuristic analysis:
  - Suspicious API calls
  - Packed/obfuscated code detection
  - Behavioral analysis patterns
- [ ] Add file type validation (PE header, ELF header)

## Phase 2: Detection and Response

### 2.1 Threat Detection
- [ ] Implement real-time scanning engine
- [ ] Add quarantine system for infected files
- [ ] Create threat classification system (malware, trojan, virus, etc.)
- [ ] Implement false positive reduction

### 2.2 User Interface
- [ ] Command-line interface for manual scans
- [ ] Interactive threat response options:
  - Delete infected file
  - Quarantine file
  - Attempt file cleaning
  - Ignore (false positive)
- [ ] Logging system for scan results
- [ ] Configuration file support

### 2.3 Response Actions
- [ ] Safe file deletion with backup
- [ ] Quarantine management (isolate, restore, delete)
- [ ] File cleaning for certain virus types
- [ ] System restore point creation (Linux equivalent)

## Phase 3: Real-time Protection

### 3.1 File System Monitoring
- [ ] Implement inotify-based file system watching
- [ ] Monitor critical system directories
- [ ] Real-time scanning of new/modified files
- [ ] Performance optimization for continuous monitoring

### 3.2 Process Interception
- [ ] Research Linux kernel module development
- [ ] Implement execve() hooking for process execution monitoring
- [ ] Add network activity monitoring
- [ ] Implement system call interception

### 3.3 Background Service
- [ ] Create daemon/service architecture
- [ ] Implement systemd service integration
- [ ] Add automatic startup configuration
- [ ] Create management interface (start/stop/configure)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Network Protection
- [ ] Implement network traffic monitoring
- [ ] Add URL/domain blacklisting
- [ ] Create firewall integration
- [ ] Add email attachment scanning

### 4.2 Update System
- [ ] Implement signature database updates
